            <h2>Programming Language</h2>
            <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Programming languages are
                described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages
                usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling.</p>

                <h2>C</h2>
                <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in
                    1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it
                    is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
                    C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>

                    distributable,
                    even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the Python Software Foundation. Python
                    can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages.
                    The following pages are a useful first step to get on your way writing programs with Python! The Python
                    Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party modules for Python. Both Python's standard library and
                    thecommunity-contributed modules allow for endless possibilities.</p>
