            <h1>What is Web Technology?</h1>
            <p>Web technology refers to the means by which computers communicate with each other using markup languages
                and multimedia packages. It gives us a way to interact with hosted information, like websites. Web
                technology involves the use of hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS).</p>

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                    JavaScript, a programming language.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written
                    without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
                    presentation characteristics; enable </p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                    application programming interfaces (APIs)</p>

                <h2>bootstrap</h2>
                <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative
                    web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to
                    apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary
                    factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.</p>
